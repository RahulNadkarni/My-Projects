Syntax Checker

DESCRIPTION
In this lab, the user enters a file into the program arguments. The program will then check if there are brace mismatches in the file. Depending on the brace locations in the file, the program will either output a success message or an error message with the location of the mismatch. This project was done for CSE12 - Computer Systems and Assembly Language at UC Santa Cruz.
