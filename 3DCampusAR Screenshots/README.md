# 3DCampusAR 

3DCampusAR was an Augmented Reality based app used to help students and parents navigate the Foothill High 
School campus. The app consisted of two modes: Walkthrough and AR. In the Walkthrough mode, users would get a first person experience of what the campus looked like, where the classrooms were located, and could develop potential routes between their classes. In AR Mode, users could select which building they were at 
and where they wished to go. In doing so, they would be able to see the fastest path to their destination. 
While the app has been pulled from the App Store after years of no updates, these are the screenshots and 
videos of the app when it first launched. 

# Files
home.png - Once users logged in to their account, this was the screen they would see- they could pick between the walkthrough or the ar mode. 

3D_Walkthrough.png, 3D_Walkthrough_2.png- These files are snapshots of what the 3D Walkthrough mode looked like. Users could move around using the joystick and could change their orientation using the camera button. 

ar_mode_3.png, ar_mode_4.png - These images are from the AR mode. Users could select their current location and their final destination using the options at the bottom of the screen. They would then see a line on the map representing the fastest path to go from building to building. 

ar_demo.mp4- This file is too large for viewing on Github, so please download the video if you wish to see the different route combinations and how the markerless Augmented Reality feature worked. After scanning a flat surface, users would tap the screen to make the campus appear. Then, they would input their location and destination to get the fastest path. 

app_demo.mp4- This file is too large for viewing on GitHub, so please download the video if you wish to see the full app demonstration. This video shows the home screen, the 3D Walkthrough feature, the AR Mode feature, and the navigation between the two. 

# Source Code 
This project was started in 2017 and finished in 2019 with potential venture applications. While it has been years since the last update, I am choosing to keep the source code private. If you wish to see the full application, please contact me at rnadkarni3@gmail.com. This app was programmed using C# and was developed in Unity.
