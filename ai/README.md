# Description
These 4 projects were some of the projects I first did when I started my journey into Artificial Intelligence in my freshman year. I recollect 
learning about these topics through Santa Cruz Artificial Intelligence, and through YouTube videos. I mainly used these projects to learn more about
SVMs, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks to explore their multifaceted applications. In recent years, I have repurposed these to use as instruction 
material for Santa Cruz Artificial Intelligence for our members to learn how these models work in a more hands-on environment. While these are not the 
original files, they contain much of the original code, and showcase where I started. 


# Happy or Sad 
Given an image of a person, the program was to determine whether he or she is happy or sad. In this project, 
my goal was to visualize an application of Convolutional Neural Networks. The architecture of the model is very simple, and only contains a few 
convolutional layers, but it is enough to see results. To try this for yourself, make sure the data is in the same folder as the file and select
a test image. By inputting the test image directly as its path name, you will get an output of 'happy' or sad'! 


# Text Generation 
In this program, the goal was to understand an application of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) in the context of Natural Language Processing. Here, given
a training set of a text file, the LSTM would learn which words appeared more frequently and with what context they would appear in. Now, if you prompt 
the model with a set of words, it will attempt to predict what word would come next. This program can be run on a text file of your choosing, but I am 
supplying 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' for an example. 


# Stock Price Predictor 

Contrary to its name, the Stock Price Predictor project was a way for me to experiment with different forms of Regression. I used Linear Regression as 
my control to test how other forms of regression faired. More specifically, I tested Lasso Regresssion, Ridge Regression, and finally Support Vector 
Regression. You can see the results when you view the file, but if you want to try it on a different stock, you can always change the value in the code.


# Housing Market Predictor 

The Housing Market Predictor was the first Machine Learning program I have ever written. In it, I took the California Housing Dataset and applied 
Linear Regression to predict the value of homes in California. This program was mainly used as a way for me to familiarize myself with numpy, pandas,
and sklearn as I started my journey into AI.
