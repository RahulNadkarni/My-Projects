# My-Projects 

Hello! My name is Rahul Nadkarni, and I am currently a first-year Master's student at New York University, majoring in Computer Science. This repository showcases my diverse programming skills and my journey in expanding my knowledge. Many of the projects here were completed during my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with specific mentions of class projects in their respective directories. I am proficient in Python, C, C++, Assembly Language, Matlab, and C#/Unity, and each project in this repository highlights my expertise in these programming languages.



Python Projects
------------
Any python project in this repository can be run using any ide. Make sure all of the files are in the same folder. 

C Projects
------------
To run the C programs, make sure that the clang compiler is installed. The projects run using all compilers, but the Makefiles provided utilize clang to compile all of the files. Make sure that all of the files are in the same folder. 

Assembly Language Project
-----------
The assembly project currently in the repository should be run using the MARS(MIPS Assembly Simulator). The test files are provided in the folder as well. If you would like to test it with one of your own files, create a new file in the same directory and use it as the input file.
