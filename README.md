# My-Projects 

Hello! My name is Rahul Nadkarni and I am currently a second year junior at UC Santa Cruz majoring in Computer Engineering. These projects exhibit my versatilie ability in programming. I am fluent in Python, C, Assembly Language, and C#/Unity. Each of the projects in the repository represent my ability in each one of these programming languages. Although 3DCampusAR, my C# and Unity project, is not shown in my repository, if you wish to see the completed project, visit 3DCampus AR on the App Store:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3dcampus-ar/id1474046485 

If you wish to see the source code and the subsequent Unity Project for 3DCampusAR, contact me at rnadkarni3@gmail.com.   

3DCampus AR
----------
3DCampus AR is an augmented reality based navigation app I developed in high school to assist students and parents in navigating my high school campus. There are two modes: A 2D Walkthrough Mode which allows for a gamified experience of walking through the campus and an AR mode which allows the user to find the fastest route between two buildings on campus. I used Unity as the primary development software and Blender as the primary 3D modeling software. I used C# to code the project as well. 
Tools Used: Unity, Blender, Photoshop, ARKit, AutoCAD

Python Projects
------------
Any python project in this repository can be run using any ide. Make sure all of the files are in the same folder. 

C Projects
------------
To run the C programs, make sure that the clang compiler is installed. The projects run using all compilers, but the Makefiles provided utilize clang to compile all of the files. Make sure that all of the files are in the same folder. 

Assembly Language Project
-----------
The assembly project currently in the repository should be run using the MARS(MIPS Assembly Simulator). The test files are provided in the folder as well. If you would like to test it with one of your own files, create a new file in the same directory and use it as the input file.
