# My-Projects 

Hello! My name is Rahul Nadkarni and I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz majoring in Computer Engineering. These projects exhibit my versatilie ability in programming. I am fluent in Python, C, C++, Assembly Language, and C#/Unity. Each of the projects in the repository represent my ability in each one of these programming languages. 



Python Projects
------------
Any python project in this repository can be run using any ide. Make sure all of the files are in the same folder. 

C Projects
------------
To run the C programs, make sure that the clang compiler is installed. The projects run using all compilers, but the Makefiles provided utilize clang to compile all of the files. Make sure that all of the files are in the same folder. 

Assembly Language Project
-----------
The assembly project currently in the repository should be run using the MARS(MIPS Assembly Simulator). The test files are provided in the folder as well. If you would like to test it with one of your own files, create a new file in the same directory and use it as the input file.
